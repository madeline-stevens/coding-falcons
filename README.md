### Welcome to Coding Falcons!
#### Coding Falcons is a school and summer coding program for students 5-8th grade. Ivette Cortez and Madeline Stevens run the program and hope to expand throughout White Center, Georgetowna and the rest of South Seattle.

This RESTful Application Programming Interface(API) is a collection of useful APIs meant for Code Fellows 301 students to reference in order to help brainstorm final project ideas. It's an API of APIs!

This portion of the project is only the back-end infrastructure and functionality to create, read, update and delete data from a user and superuser standpoint. These two types of users can create an authenticated account to search through our small database of popular APIs by category, vet each API to ensure it will be useful, then add them to a list of favorites. Only the superuser has API update and delete privileges.

### Project description
Using node.js, HTTP, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose we have created a Server that responds to different GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE responses from a developer, backend position. The requests to our live server can interact with a remote Database created through Mlabs. In this example we use two schemas- Users and APIs. There are two types of Users, SuperUser and User. Only the SuperUser can POST, PUT, and DELETE. This project represents what is possible with a few simple tools.
