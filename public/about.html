                            A Chicago native, Ivette has dedicated most of her life to working with underrepresented populations. A first generation daughter of Guatemalan immigrants, she would spend her summers in Guatemala, where she developed a love of learning. In 2016, she learned front-end development and uses her skills to develop a programming curriculum at Holy Family Bilingual School. She is passionate about empowering women, girls, and promoting equity and diversity in tech and hopes to introduce programming to more generations of students in Seattle.
